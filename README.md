This is code for the paper "Optimal Control of Hybrid Systems via Measure Relaxations".

## Getting Started
The code assumes an installation of [MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com/) and [GUROBI](https://www.gurobi.com/).

## Running the experiments
1. Clone the repository and `instantiate` a Julia environment.
2. Run the experiments with `./run.sh`. Results will be written to the `out/` folder.
