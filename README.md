This is code for the paper "Optimal Control of Hybrid Systems via Occupation Measures".

## Getting Started
The code requires an installation of the SDP solver [MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com/) and the MIQP solver [GUROBI](https://www.gurobi.com/).

## Running the experiments
1. Clone the repository, then `activate`  and `instantiate` a Julia environment.
2. Run the experiments with `run_all.sh`. Results will be written to the `img` folder.
